# Flight_delay_prediction
This is a academic project related to prediction of flight delay time based on the factors responsible for the delay.
Problem-
As people increasingly choose to travel by air, the number of flights that fail to take off on time also increases. This growth exacerbates the crowded situation at airports and causes financial difficulties within the airline industry. Air transportation delay indicates the lack of efficiency of the aviation system. It is a high cost to both airline companies and their passengers. 
Building a model to classify flights as cancelled or delayed and hence predict the delay time of the flight will be extremely helpful for the airline industry as the respective officials can accordingly plan their strategies to reduce the number of flight delays and hence improve the functioning of aviation industry.

Study universe:
US-based data for different Airlines of year 2018
Marketing Carrier On-Time Performance of the Flights-various factors related to cancelled, delayed and on-time flights

Modelling universe:
Only the Variables causing the Flight delay or getting cancelled

Scoring universe:
Flights which may have been cancelled or delayed (suspected)

Defaulting universe:
Flights which are cancelled or delayed.

Business problem statement:
As a Businessman or manager of any company, it is crucial to focus on customer services. As an airline company, flight getting delayed or cancelled is a big issue and very inconvenient for the customers/travellers. It affects the customers' belief and reputation of the airline company.
